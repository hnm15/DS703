        "## Due: Midnight on October 12th @ Midnight (with 2-hour grace period) and worth 85 points.\n",

        "## As announced, I'll not start to count late days until midnight on 10/13 (with same grace period).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment you’ll practice **probabilistic language modeling (PLM)** by building N-Gram models that generate text. Along the way, you’ll develop the core pieces of a language model: estimating probabilities, calculating sentence likelihoods, and generating text with different strategies. The goal is to understand *how simple statistical models can produce coherent language*, and to explore refinements that make them more expressive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "* Build and compare **unigram, bigram, and trigram** language models.\n",
        "* Calculate **word and sentence probabilities** (in log-space) and use them to measure **perplexity**.\n",
        "* Implement **probability-based generation** methods, including temperature-scaled sampling.\n",
        "* Explore **beam search** as a way to generate higher-quality sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The four problems (high level)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Problem 1 — N-Gram probabilities:**\n",
        "   Build unigram, bigram, and trigram models. Compute next-word probabilities in log space to avoid numerical underflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Problem 2 — Sentence probability & perplexity:**\n",
        "   Define sentence probability, normalize for sentence length, and calculate perplexity as a measure of model quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Problem 3 — Controlled generation:**\n",
        "   Implement temperature-controlled sampling to vary randomness in generated sentences. Compare low vs. high temperatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Problem 4 — Beam search:**\n",
        "   Use perplexity to guide **beam search**, keeping track of the most likely candidate sentences at each step, and compare outputs to greedy generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you’ll have a working N-Gram generator capable of producing reasonable and a solid understanding of how early probabilistic approaches to NLP laid the foundation for modern deep learning methods.\n",

        "### Recommended Workflow (Must Read!)\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most important skills in machine learning is following a **disciplined workflow** when developing complex code. The basic idea is simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start small:** Write and test your code using a tiny subset of your dataset.\n",
        "2. **Inspect your results:** Print out and examine intermediate outputs to verify that each step behaves as expected.\n",
        "3. **Iterate and tune:** Adjust hyperparameters and continue testing, gradually increasing the subset size as needed.\n",
        "4. **Scale up:** Once you are confident your code is bug-free and your hyperparameters are roughly correct, run it on the **full dataset** to obtain your final results.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don’t have sufficient computing resources for a full run, use **as large a subset as practical** — provided you’ve begun early enough to allow for multiple iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To help you follow this workflow in this homework, I’ve included a variable `num_sentences` that controls how many sentences are used from the shuffled Brown Corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "I recommend the following progression:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Step 1:** Begin with `num_sentences = 10` to debug and print out intermediate data structures (such as dictionaries) to confirm that your code works as expected.\n",
        "* **Step 2:** Increase to `num_sentences = 100` to verify correctness and complete most of the homework efficiently.\n",
        "* **Step 3:** Finally, if possible, run with the full dataset (`num_sentences = 57_340`), or as large a subset as your resources allow, to answer the graded questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 9 problems in this homework, each worth 9 points each, and you get 4 points free if you otherwise complete the homework."

It was the **first electronic, balanced corpus of English** ever created and contains about **one million words** drawn from **500 written texts** published in the United States in 1961.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time, this was groundbreaking: instead of studying isolated examples, linguists and computer scientists could analyze the **statistical properties of language** across many genres. The Brown Corpus became a **benchmark dataset** in early computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and later in natural language processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Genres in the Brown Corpus\n",
        "\n",
        "The 500 texts were divided evenly across **15 categories**, each representing a different register or style of writing:\n",

        "* **Press**: reportage, editorials, reviews\n",
        "* **General prose**: popular lore, belles lettres, essays\n",
        "* **Fiction**: adventure, romance, science fiction, mystery, humor\n",
        "* **Learned writing**: academic and scientific publications\n",
        "* **Religious writing**: sermons, expository texts\n",
        "* **Skills and hobbies**: manuals, do-it-yourself, gardening, sports writing\n",
        "* **Government documents**: official reports, public affairs writing\n",
        "* **Miscellaneous**: popularized non-fiction, biography\n",

        "* **Press**: articles from major U.S. newspapers and magazines such as *Time* and *Newsweek*.\n",
        "* **Religion**: sermons, Bible commentary, religious essays.\n",

        "* **Historical importance**: the first large corpus, setting the stage for all later corpus linguistics.\n",

        "1. **Smoothing produces tiny probabilities.** With add-one or Kneser–Ney smoothing, many n-grams have very small values, making underflow more likely.\n",

        "3. **Consistency with NLP practice.** Modern language models (n-gram and neural alike) always work in log-space. Teaching it here ensures the method scales to larger datasets like Shakespeare, WikiText, or web-scale corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The log-space trick\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall how computing in log-space works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Convert your numbers to logs\n",

        "- Convert back to normal if you want to print it out in human-readable form as a metric or use it with code that expects normal probabilities (e.g., softmax, or sampling).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, instead of multiplying probabilities, we sum log probabilities:\n",
        "\n",

        "This prevents underflow, keeps values in a manageable numeric range, and makes computation easier.\n",

It’s also the standard method in NLP, so it’s best to learn it now.\n",
